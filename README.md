# 🔬 Mechanism Reduction using Genetic Algorithms and Graph Neural Networks (GA-GNN)

This repository implements a complete pipeline for **chemical reaction mechanism reduction** using a combination of:

- 🧬 **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** for selecting optimal species subsets,
- 🧠 **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** for learning species importance and guiding GA initialization,
- 🔥 **Cantera** reactor simulations to validate physical fidelity of reduced models.

Our fully functional **Prototype v1** performs end-to-end reduction, evaluates the quality using ignition delay and progress variable (PV) error, and exports CSVs and plots for detailed analysis.

## 🚀 How to Run the Pipeline

```bash
python -m testing.run_tests --mechanism data/gri30.yaml --out results --steps 200 --tf 5.0
````

* `--mechanism`: Path to the full chemical mechanism file (default: `data/gri30.yaml`)
* `--out`: Folder where outputs are saved (auto-created if missing)
* `--steps`: Integration steps for the batch reactor simulation
* `--tf`: Final time for simulation (in seconds)

---

## 📁 What Gets Saved in `results/`

* `ga_fitness.csv` — Best fitness score per generation
* `debug_fitness.csv` — Full fitness breakdown for all GA individuals (PV error, delay diff, penalties)
* `gnn_scores.csv` — Species importance scores predicted by GNN
* `convergence.png` — GA fitness evolution over generations
* `profiles.png` — Mass fraction comparison of key species (Full vs Reduced)
* `ignition_delay.png` — Ignition delay for reduced mechanism
* `pv_error.png` — PV error (progress variable deviation)

---

## 🧠 GNN Integration

The GNN model is trained on species graph constructed from Cantera with:

* Node features: out-degree, in-degree, and normalized thermo ranges
* Trained using known species importance from full simulation
* Predicts importance scores saved to `gnn_scores.csv`

These scores are used to seed GA with biologically/chemically meaningful individuals.

## ⚙️ Dependencies

Make sure to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install cantera networkx torch torch_geometric matplotlib
```

Python ≥ 3.9 is recommended. Tested with `cantera==3.0.0`.

## 📈 Example Output Quality

With `tf=5.0`, `generations=25`, and `GNN epochs=15`:

* ✅ PV Error: \~0.0175
* ✅ Ignition Delay: \~0.025 s (realistic)
* ✅ Species Profiles: CH₄, O₂, CO₂ match full mechanism closely
* ✅ GNN Scores show strong separation between critical and inert species
* ✅ GA shows smooth fitness convergence across generations
